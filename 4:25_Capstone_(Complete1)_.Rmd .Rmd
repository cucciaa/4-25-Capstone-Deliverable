## Business Understanding
Good quality wine is typically characterized by a balance of several factors including acidity, tannins, alcohol content, sweetness, and the wine's overall structure. Wine quality is often judged by consumers based on taste preferences, which may vary by region, culture, and even personal preference. Generally, higher-quality wines tend to have well-balanced acidity and alcohol levels, appropriate residual sugar content, and fewer defects, such as high volatile acidity. Wine ratings, like those used in this dataset, are often influenced by expert panels and consumer reviews, which typically rate the wines on a scale (e.g., 1-10). Factors such as the vineyard’s terroir (environmental factors), the grape variety, and production techniques such as fermentation temperature and time, also play significant roles in determining the final quality.

## Data Understanding
The dataset used for this analysis comes from the UCI Wine Quality Database and includes chemical and sensory attributes of red and white wines, specifically:

Fixed Acidity: Influences the taste of the wine, contributing to its tartness and aging potential.
Volatile Acidity: A measure of wine spoilage, typically an undesirable trait at high levels.
Citric Acid: Contributes to the wine's freshness and acidity.
Residual Sugar: Impacts the sweetness of the wine.
Chlorides: Higher levels can result in undesirable salty flavors.
Free Sulfur Dioxide: Helps preserve wine but excessive levels can result in an unpleasant taste.
Total Sulfur Dioxide: A form of sulfur used in wine preservation.
Density: Affects the mouthfeel and body of the wine.
pH: Influences the wine's acidity.
Sulphates: Adds to the wine's preservation and stability.
Alcohol: A key factor influencing the body and taste of wine.
Quality: A subjective rating assigned by consumers and wine experts.

## What Types are the Data?
Ratio: Fixed Acidity, Volatile Acidity, Citric Acid, Residual Sugar, Chlorides, Free Sulfur Dioxide, Total Sulfur Dioxide, Density, Sulphates, Alcohol

Interval: pH

Ordinal: Quality

This dataset has no missing values and consists of 6,497 instances from both red and white wines, providing a sufficient sample for analysis.

## Purpose
> We needed to extract some “actionable” insights from the UCI Wine Quality Data Set . The purpose is that a wine producer has hired us to better understand what factors affect wine quality. The producer can also look at which production factors have an effect on rating scores by consumers. The reason why we utilized exploratory data analysis is show different distributions of certain production techniques and why consumers probably favor one type of wine over the other.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Quality Distribution
```{r quality-distribution, fig.cap="Distribution of Quality Scores by Wine Type"}
ggplot(data, aes(x = factor(quality), fill = type)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Quality Score Distribution",
       x = "Quality Score", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```
> Red wine ratings have had stayed mainly in the five to six ranges. White wine ratings had higher ratings with six, seven, and eight. Reveals whether one wine type generally receives higher ratings. Additonally, white wine has an overall higher rating than red wine and shows an overall wider spread than it. In conclusion this can mean that white wine is more enjoyed than red wine to consumers. Another reason could be that white wine also outnumbers red wine in the amount of observations.

### Chemical Properties
```{r chemical-boxplots, fig.cap="Key Chemical Properties by Wine Type"}
features <- c("alcohol", "pH", "residual.sugar", "volatile.acidity")
plot_list <- lapply(features, function(feat) {
  ggplot(data, aes(x = type, y = .data[[feat]])) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(title = feat, y = feat) +
    theme_minimal()
})

# Print all plots
a <- plot_list[[1]]
for(p in plot_list) print(p)
```
> The first box-plot compares alcohol levels for red and white wine. The white wine has a higher median than the red wine and most of the white wine's data points are clustered towards the top while the red wine's data points are clustered more towards the bottom. This means that on average, white wine contains more alcohol than red wine.


The second box-plot represents ph levels of both types of wine. The higher the ph level, the less acidic the, which we see with the white wine. Red wine acoording to the box plots has a higher acidic level.


The third box-plot compares the levels of residual sugar. While looking at the box-plot, one could infer that since white wine data points cluster towards the top, it is safe to say that white wine tends to be sweeter than red wine since the red wine data points are clustered more twoards the bottom.



Finally, the last box-plot compares the wines' data based off of volatile acidity. While studying the box-plot, it is shown that the red wine quartile range has a higher value than the white wine's range, meaning that red wine tends to have a higher volatile acidity. One question to ask would be "What is the difference between ph level testing and volatile acidity?" The main difference is that the two measure different ideas of acid. Ph levels are often the measure how strong the acid feeling is while you consume something acidic. On the contrary volatile acidity "is a measure of the low molecular weight (or steam distillable) fatty acids in wine and is generally percieved as the odour of vinegar" (Australian Wine Research Institute, 2018, p. 2).



Lastly, these are important chemical differences to look into becasue most of the time it depends on what the consumer is preferring, whether it is a less acidic feeling while drinking, the amount of alcohol, the amount of sugar, or the amount of fatty acids in their wine.

### Correlation Heatmaps
```{r correlation-heatmaps, fig.cap="Correlation Matrices for Red and White Wines"}
cor_red   <- cor(filter(data, type == "red")   %>% select(-type))
cor_white <- cor(filter(data, type == "white") %>% select(-type))

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
corrplot(cor_red,   main = "Red Wine",   mar = c(0,0,1,0))
corrplot(cor_white, main = "White Wine", mar = c(0,0,1,0))
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
```
> Similarly to the box plots above, these correlational heatmaps only test the chemical compisitions in wine. However, the box-plots only compared the marginal distributions between the red and white wine. The correlational heatmaps test the relationship between quality and chemicals that are inside. The darer the circle, the strongher the correlation. The darker the blue, the more of a positve correlation while if it has a red shade, it is closer to a negative correlation. While looking at the some of the circles for red wine, it is clear that ph and alcohol do not have that strong of a coreelation with one another because the circle is light blue, meaning that its value is not close to one or negative one. One strong relationship that one could pull from the heatmap is that alcohol and quality have a strong correlational relationship. Compared to white wine, it has a slightly darker color menaing that the relationship between quality and alcohol is stronger in red.

## Statistical Testing
### T-Test for Mean Quality
```{r t-test-quality}
ttest <- t.test(quality ~ type, data = data)
tidy(ttest)
```
> The purpose of this is to run a two-sample t-test comparing the means of white and red wine. Estimate one represents the mean quality red wine while Estimate 2 represents the mean quality of white wine. As shown, white wine has a higher mean quality proving that white wine is favored more by consumers.

### Alcohol vs Quality Correlation
```{r corr-test-alcohol}
cor_red_alc   <- cor.test(filter(data, type == "red")$alcohol,
                            filter(data, type == "red")$quality)
cor_white_alc <- cor.test(filter(data, type == "white")$alcohol,
                            filter(data, type == "white")$quality)

list(
  red   = tidy(cor_red_alc),
  white = tidy(cor_white_alc)
)
```
> For this table, we decided to run a pearson correlation between qualtiy and alcohol level. We already compared the two wines with these statistics in the heatmap above. Similarly, it is proven that both wines have a strong relationship when it comes quality and alcohol. Additionally, it is also proven that red wine has a stronger link between the two than white wine but only by a small marigin. Both of the p-vaulues being significant proves these tests are legit and the results we gathered during this study is reliable.

## Conclusion
> Overall, our exploratory analysis concludes that white wines are favored more than red wines. White wine has earned a score of 5.88, while red wine has earned a score of 5.64, with a statistically significant difference of 0.24. Alcohol remains one of the strongest determining factors for consumers with red wine having a higher score than white (.48 > .44). Additionally, volotility acididty has a stringer affect on red wine with a score of 0.39, compared to white which had a -0.19, showing that less volotility acididty is favored. Sweetness and ph levels played less of a role in quality according to the heatmap, however white wine had a sweeter taste while red wine had a higher ph level. In conclusion the observation can be definite is that white wine producers should stick to sweeter wines while red wine producers should stick to a higher level ph method of making wine.
